# Data Science and Machine Learning with R

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing my understanding and hands-on practice with **R programming** in the context of **data science**, **machine learning** and **visualizations**. 

These notebooks are not part of any one project, but rather reflect my exploration of techniques, libraries and concepts in R.

## 📁 Notebooks

- **R.ipynb**: Covers a range of data science workflows using R, including data manipulation, modeling and visualization.
- **R_Notebook.ipynb**: Continues with deeper or separate experiments related to ML algorithms, plots and statistical analysis.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

- Data Cleaning and Manipulation (`dplyr`, `tidyr`)
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (`ggplot2`, `plotly`)
- Machine Learning models (`caret`, `randomForest`, `e1071`)
- Statistical Concepts and Custom Functions
- Model Evaluation and Metrics
- Interactive Visuals

## 💡 Purpose

This repo serves as a **personal learning showcase** and a reflection of my **proficiency in R for data science**. It is not tied to a single dataset or problem, but rather a collection of experiments, techniques and learning moments.

## 🧰 Requirements

To run the notebooks, make sure you have:
- R installed with Jupyter support
- Required R libraries (`ggplot2`, `caret`, `dplyr`, etc.)

## 📌 Note

These notebooks are written and executed using the R kernel in Jupyter.
