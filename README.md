# Data Science and Machine Learning with R

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing my understanding and hands-on practice with **R programming** in the context of **data science**, **machine learning**, and **visualizations**.

These notebooks are not part of any one project, but rather reflect my exploration of techniques, libraries, and concepts in R.

## üìÅ Notebooks

- **R.ipynb**: Covers a range of data science workflows using R, including data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
- **R_Notebook.ipynb**: Continues with deeper or separate experiments related to ML algorithms, plots, and statistical analysis.
- **LR_in_R.ipynb**: A focused walkthrough of linear regression in R, including model fitting, evaluation, and interpretation.
- **Rpacks.ipynb**: An overview and demo of various R packages used across different stages of data analysis and machine learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

- Data Cleaning and Manipulation (`dplyr`, `tidyr`)
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (`ggplot2`, `plotly`)
- Machine Learning models (`caret`, `randomForest`, `e1071`)
- Linear Regression and Model Diagnostics
- Statistical Concepts and Custom Functions
- Package Exploration and Utility Functions
- Model Evaluation and Metrics
- Interactive Visuals

## üí° Purpose

This repo serves as a **personal learning showcase** and a reflection of my **proficiency in R for data science**. It is not tied to a single dataset or problem, but rather a collection of experiments, techniques, and learning moments.

## üß∞ Requirements

To run the notebooks, make sure you have:
- R installed with Jupyter support
- Required R libraries (`ggplot2`, `caret`, `dplyr`, `randomForest`, `plotly`, etc.)

Install missing packages using:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "caret", "randomForest", "e1071", "plotly"))
